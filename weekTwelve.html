          I've only just started looking into what APIs are and at first I was a bit confused before digging into them on my own. I like learning with practical stuff, I think I mentioned this before. When I'm learning about something new I like to visualize it before executing it. And it always works for me. So when I was looking at what APIs are, I learned they just connect different applications to build one larger application with a specific purpose. It forms a puzzle, and where those puzzles connect is what APIs are. Much like what the UI is for the User, APIs are just like UI but for code. When a user interacts with the UI by entering or logging in their user information, that information goes through the front end, and to reach the back end for verification, it has to go through an API first. Explaining it is tricky at times, but I have these mental images of what APIs do now.
          So how will I use these on my website? To be honest, I currently have no clue. I've been spending so much time trying to fix some bugs and work on the responsive design of my website that I sort of overlooked APIs until just now. They do sound cool though, and the more research I do on them the more examples of what APIs can do I find. Being overwhelmed with different if not endless choices can be distracting so for now I'll leave APIs for later on. This is where I believe my shortcomings will surface, deciding which API to work with.
