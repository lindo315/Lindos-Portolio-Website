                This is the final design for my website. I chose to adopt the base minimalistic style so that I don't distract of overwhelme the user from the beginning. The top navigation bar is interactive and save the user time to scroll all the way down to a section they want to see or all the way up to the home page again. The logo, I had to code that because I had this idea in the beginning of keeping most of my content code if it is something interactive.

              <h3 class="art4-stuff">
                This is the final design for my work section (portfolio sort of). I also chose to follow through with my demo here too and code things as they looked in the demo. Which proved to be difficult. My previous design did not satisfy me because I needed something compact and to the point, also it has to be easier for users to navigate across it and so I chose this. It showcases my two prime skills (which need more work), and gives a brief overview of the work I have done.
              </h3>
              <br>
              <h3 class="art4-stuff">
                I did not want to put all my work on a separate page (my portfolio) because of time, also that would mean I would have to put in more artwork and web design work which there is little of for now. And since the website is focused more on school work too, I had to keep this section short, compact and brief.

This font stack provides a clean and modern look for my headings and subheadings.

            <strong>Photos</strong>: For this I chose to use high-quality photographs throughout the website to showcase our my art, webpage and wireframes, and enhance the overall user experience. I selected the right photos that go along with what I want the website to convey to others.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Illustrations</strong>: In addition to photographs, I chose to use a few illustrations on some of some of the sections to add visual interest and break up text-heavy content. These illustrations (lines) were costume designed by me to fit the structuring of my wesite.

          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Image Sizes</strong>: To ensure that my images look great, I've optimized their sizes. The photos are sized to fit any div they are under and range from 1000px in width to 800px - 250px, and 500px - 250px in height. They are sized appropriately for their placement on the page.

          <li>
            <strong>Grid System</strong>: To create a consistent and organized layout throughout my website, I've implemented a grid system in my work section. The grid consists of 2 columns and 3 rows, allowing me to showcase my weekly work in an organized and visually appealing way. Each column has a maximum width of 510px and each row has a maximum height of 300px, ensuring that my content is easily visible and accessible.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>White Space</strong>: I've also incorporated ample white space into my layout to help content breathe and create a balanced composition. This not only makes the website more visually appealing but also improves readability and user experience.

          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Responsive Design</strong>: To ensure that my website is accessible and easy to use on all devices, I've implemented a responsive design. The website adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring that the content adjusts to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

        <h3 class="wireframe-below2">
          My goal is to create a modern and dynamic portfolio website that showcases my weekly (school work) work and portfolio work outside of school in an organized and visually appealing way, while prioritizing readability and user experience. I aimed to achieve this through a clean and minimalist design, with a focus on bold typography, ample white space (where needed), and a color palette that is both sophisticated and eye-catching.

          This goal is aligned with my overall objective of growing my currenlty non-existant client base and expanding my reach in the industry.
          To ensure that the website is aligned with this goal, I've created a clean and professional (or so I think) design that highlights my current skills and work in a cool way (or so I think). I've also prioritized user experience, making it easy for potential "clients" to navigate my website and find the information they need.
          By aligning my website's goals with our overall business objectives, I can ensure that our online presence is a valuable asset in achieving me long-term goals.
