        The company has a website online, which I choose to focus on in this essay because of its unique design and the product it's advertising. On that note, I'd like to first describe or give a summary of the website's purpose and use. The purpose of the company's website is to provide an online presence for it and to showcase its products, services, and brand. It serves as a digital platform to communicate with customers, potential customers, investors, and other stakeholders. And those being the target audience, they will focus on certain if not different aspects of the website as they use it. With current customers interacting with provided account management tools, support resources, and information about the company's products and services for existing customers. For potential customers, the website showcases Openserve's products and services, pricing, and promotions to attract new customers. And so the target audience varies depending on how people view or want to use the company's services.

      <h1 class="blog-text">
        The website has a couple of interesting main features located in its navigation bar. These features are the Home Page, Get Connected, Products and Services, Discover, Help, Contact, and Search. Going through each of them, they all serve a different purpose that helps the customer (or user), interact with ease with the website and find whatever information necessary to them, provided by the website. The Home page is the landing page of the website, and it provides a sort of summary of the company and some of the services it provides. It doesn't go into much detail, but one can see some of the company's promotions and deals, which the user can click on if they're immediately interested. The Get Connected bar provides information links for services the company provides. As it's called, this bar provides users with several different connection services to the internet. Whether it's business, residential, home, or with customers. It provides different deals and promotions for each, offering good broadband deals specific to the customers' needs. The Products and Services bar provides different categories of services the company has to offer. From Broadband to Internet or Data, Managed Services, and Voice for calls. Discover helps users if they want to know more about Openserve, the Help bar provides a chatbot to “help guide you around the site, answer questions, and direct you to the info you need.” And lastly, the Contact bar provides contact information for the company if users and customers need help with something related to the company.

        Looking at the overall UI present, the website has a simplistic but well-structured and well-styled design. It uses a few design elements to make itself visually appealing and provide a functional interface for users.

        Looking at the overall UI present, the website has a simplistic but well-structured and well-styled design. It uses a few design elements to make itself visually appealing and provide a functional interface for users.
        The Visual Hierarchy. A clear visual hierarchy helps guide users through the website by highlighting important elements and content. This can be achieved through the use of headings, subheadings, font size, colour, and contrast. Starting with headings and font sizes, the Openserve website presents its most important pieces of information of text the company wants users to see first on their website. For example, on the homepage when the user first sees the content of the website, the words FREE are the biggest and boldest, in all caps. As soon as the user notices this, it grabs their attention prompting them to explore whatever deal the website has to offer. Anything that is related to the product they are selling or a service they are offering has a bolder font to grab people's attention. For colour and contrast, the website uses contrasting colours the same as their business logo to create a unique visual aesthetic, using brighter colours like white in the background and darker ones for text (others bolder) in a hierarchy of importance. The more important the information is the bolder or darker the font is. This is to, again, grab the user's attention. Also, the alignment of images and text on the page make it seem more organized and structured properly. Nothing seems to be out of place, even the buttons are aligned just right underneath a block of information related to it.
      </h1>

      <h1 class="blog-text">
        Navigation was already mentioned in detail above. The navigation menu helps users quickly and easily find the information they are looking for and it was achieved through a simple and intuitive menu structure with clear labels and categories. Mostly information links. But Openserve doesn't use a lot of labels (or icons). And this is where visual cues come to play. Visual cues such as icons (or labels), images, and graphics can help guide users through the website and make it more engaging and visually appealing. It also makes it consistent with the use of the right labels, images, fonts, and colours. Making it easier for the user to navigate around the website without confusion. Back to visual cues, the website only has four icons, the search icon for the search bar, the location icon for location, the lock icon for logging in on the website, and lastly, the company's icon, its logo. They all serve as consistent and familiar visual cues for users familiar with navigating websites.
      </h1>

      <h1 class="blog-text">
        The website also uses a few graphics and images that sort of correspond with whatever information they are sharing in that section. The get connected bar shows a rocket graphic as a way (as I see it) to represent a fast connection to wherever the user wants to. The products and services bar uses a box with floating items in it to represent the things the company has in store and can offer to users at fair prices. The website also uses more graphics to show different types of deals and services depending on the customers' needs, like a house graphic for home internet, a business house graphic, an estate graphic, and lastly a server graphic for customer use. Visually, these graphics correspond with the product being advertised by the website.

      <h1 class="blog-text">
        After analysing the UI, I'll now focus on the user experience of the website. How easy is it for users to accomplish their tasks on the website? Are there any obstacles that could hinder the user's experience? How have the design elements and navigation structure impacted the overall usability of the website? I'm using these questions to help guide me in looking at the UX on Openserve's website.
      </h1>

      <h1 class="blog-text">
        When the user enters the website for the first time, the information provided to them on the homepage should not overwhelm them but provide enough information to help them navigate the website and complete a certain task if they have to. I'll refer to that last bit as task accomplishment. The website is designed in a way that makes it easy for users to accomplish their tasks. For example, if a user wants to find information about Openserve's internet plans, they can do so by referring to the navigation bar which is a placeholder for any information or deals the website has about the company. Openserve's navigation on the website is simplistic and uses well-known navigation mechanics with minimal animations that can confuse the user. They focus more on my making it functional than pretty. Which serves well for what it's trying to sell. But if users encounter obstacles such as confusing navigation or slow-loading pages, they may become frustrated and leave the website.
      </h1>

      <h1 class="blog-text">
        But the navigation structure when it comes to the website's links can be an obstacle on its own. Not that they don't work or anything, just that they can be overwhelming at times. Openserve is a large company and it's selling a variety of different services and products. This means that they have to go into detail with most of the products they sell and the deals they have to offer. And sometimes they can't put all that information in one page or two. So they create separate pages for each link, each deal, each product, and each information tab they have for that product. Making the homepage clean, which is good. But it's also flooded with links, and this can make users no longer want to browse through each link to find what they want. Openserve might have tackled this obstacle or issue by creating a search bar and a chatbot to assist new or current users find what they need or ask questions they might have. Another good thing is that users can try and contact the company itself if they have specific needs both the search bar and chatbot can't provide. Though these are the only obstacles I've seen and faced while using the website, I say that it did its best to make everything look clean and functional without bugs. And their assistance services could prove useful to people who find it hard to navigate through the website.

      <h1 class="blog-text">
        This brings me to Ethics. Evaluating the ethics of the interaction design. Does the website prioritize the user's privacy and security? Are there any design elements that could be perceived as manipulative or exploitative? How does the website handle sensitive user data and personal information?
      </h1>

      <h1 class="blog-text">
        From what I've researched, Openserve, as a telecommunications company, may collect and store personal information about its users, such as names, addresses, and payment information. To prioritize the privacy and security of its users' personal information, Openserve has implemented strong security measures such as HTTPS encryption and two-factor authentication. HTTPS encryption ensures that all communication between the user's browser and the Openserve website is encrypted and cannot be intercepted by third parties. Two-factor authentication adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of identification, such as a code sent to their mobile phone, in addition to their password.
      </h1>

      <h1 class="blog-text">
        To add to these security measures, Openserve also provides clear and transparent information about how user data is collected, stored, and used. This can include a clear and accessible privacy policy that outlines what information is collected, how it is stored, and how it is used. Users also have the ability to opt-out of data collection and can be informed if their personal information is ever shared with third parties. Through such prioritizations of the privacy and security of its user's personal information and providing clear and transparent information about its data practices, Openserve's website helps build trust with its users and demonstrates its commitment to ethical interaction design. 
      </h1>

      <h1 class="blog-text"> 
        In this essay, I've analysed the website's UI and noted the effective use of colour, typography, and layout to create a visually appealing navigation structure. In terms of UX design, I found that the website made it easy for users to accomplish their tasks, with clear calls to action and accessible content. However, there were some areas for improvement, such as reducing clutter and streamlining the navigation, there were too many links and pages present, making the site overwhelming at times. In terms of ethics, I observed and explained that the company prioritizes the privacy and security of its user's personal information, provides clear and transparent information about its data practices, and avoids any design elements that could be perceived as exploitative. 
        In conclusion, the company has made a great effort in providing an effective and user-friendly website, while also demonstrating a commitment to ethical practices that prioritize the privacy and security of its users.
