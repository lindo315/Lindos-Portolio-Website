          <strong>Progress on Website: </strong>So far, I have not made any changes to my website as I'm still currently working on my tutorials, tasks, and other assignments. But I've learned some new tricks to use for my responsive design on my website and the CSS looks promising. JavaScript on the other hand is still proving to be a challenge even though I get some of the core concepts. Implementing it on my website is not going to be tricky though as I have not yet discovered in what ways I'll incorporate JavaScript. There are a few I already had before but working on new ones for responsiveness will prove to be a challenge I hope not.

          <strong>Reflection on Reading: </strong>This week I chose to work with the Birhane and Guest article on decolonizing computational sciences. It talks about and provides “valuable” insights into the need for a more inclusive and diverse approach in computational sciences. I found the reading to sort of connect with our previous discussion on information geographies and reinforce the importance of examining digital inequalities. The authors argue that computational sciences have been shaped by the West, which the authors believe perpetuates colonial legacies and reinforce existing power imbalances. Which I believe resonates with last week's digital inequalities but life path-wise/career-wise in this matter. The authors then propose strategies such as recognizing diverse knowledge systems, engaging with local communities, and restructuring educational curriculums, which can all provide some sort of practical approach for decolonizing computational sciences. The reading urges people to examine the existing underlying beliefs and power dynamics in computational sciences and highlights ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, and accountability. So embracing a decolonial approach to this, we can work towards a more equitable and inclusive computational space that shows a more diverse perspective and addresses digital inequalities.
