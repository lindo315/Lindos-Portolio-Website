          I've been working consistently on my responsive design, and it's been proving a challenge since I hard-coded most of my website. And so, certain things would break if I were to change the code or edit it here and there. So what I did was, to go back and restructure my code the right way, like I should've in assignment one. I noticed that coding the right way makes it easier for you to make certain changes or edit certain parts of your website (or code), depending on what you want to change. Because then, your code is easier to read and understand, and it follows all the right conventions meaning it's easier to look up on the internet any issues you might come across. And I came across so many of them, I'm still fighting a few and I'm afraid I'm running out of time. But overall, for now, I'm focused on making my code more structured and my website easy to follow because I've changed a lot in my code, and it sort of messed up the previous structure of the website itself. I did not like that. But I'm working on making things better.

          Technocolonialism, as explored by Madianou, talks about the unequal power dynamics and inequalities carried out by Western technology and digital innovation. The article sheds light on the extraction of data from marginalized communities and its utilization by global tech giants, often disregarding local contexts and values. Which links well with digital inequalities explored on Week 10 in the Birhane and Guest article. And links in asking the questions of what impact these practices have on stereotypes, discrimination, and exclusion. It calls for a critical reflection on the need for inclusive and ethical approaches that empower marginalized communities instead of reinforcing existing inequalities. In a way, this article sort of resembled the “Decolonising Computational Sciences article” and “Digital Inequalities and why they matter” articles. They explored the same concepts mentioned above to a certain extent.
