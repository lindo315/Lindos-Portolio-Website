        I ran into some trouble while coding my School Work section. I had this idea of using a grid system to structure everything nicely but I'm not sure it'll work. By this I mean, before, I wanted to put pictures and diagrams inside each grid that covers everything that happened that week but it proved to be a challenge. So now I'm stuck on either losing this grid idea and switching to something more generic or find another trick to pull it trhough.
