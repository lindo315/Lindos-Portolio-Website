          <strong>What went wrong?</strong>
          When I received my results I was quite surprised until it dawned on me that I did have some major flaws when it came to my code. When I started working on the website I was so excited, I had been waiting to do so since last year, and when we got the go-ahead I rushed in and did everything I could to make the best website I could. I did not pay too much attention to how my code was structured, only how the website looked and its layouts. It got to the point that I had been working on the website for weeks now and I was so invested in it. Time flew by, and only a week was left before the due date. My first mistake was leaving out some things on the rubric (paying close attention to what it wanted), I was now focused on what the website needed. I finished it and submitted it without proofreading most of it (especially my code, it was ugly). And all of this explained most of my marks (and the theory too). I neglected the simple requirements and basics and focused on what people would see and not so much on the code. This is what I believed went wrong, everything I have mentioned.

          <strong>What went right?</strong>
          I would say what went right was my attitude towards the entire assignment, I was not taking any risks with it and worked on it whenever I had the time. The look and aesthetic it had were what I believed went the best way. I wanted a website I would enjoy going over or looking at, but not get information overload while spending time with it, so I made it shorter and easier to excess, especially certain sections of the website. I believe that is what went right for my website.

          <strong>Where did you struggle?</strong>
          Theory, I always struggle with theory especially applying it. I am used to working with practical stuff, things I can see and perform. Reading through entire readings is not really for me but I try my best to go through the work. Only this time I lacked, I spent too much time on the website (practical) and very little time on theory and I had to do that last minute. Which is why I did not get satisfactory marks on it. But I am planning to improve on it over time and make good on my progress in understanding web development and how theory is important to do so. I believe.

          <strong>What would you do differently?</strong>
          FOCUS ON WHAT IS NEEDED/REQUIRED. I believe I spent too much time focusing on what I wanted and very little on what the rubric or assignment wanted, and the average marks are a testament to this. If I had spent an equal amount of time on both the practical and the theory I would have performed better on likely both departments, even though the theory was the most lacking. I also neglected what the rubric wanted. I did not even look at it due to the excitement of making my very first website. And so, my enthusiasm was placed wrongly, and so next time (this time) for the second assignment I will pay very close attention to what is needed from me.

          Before I had read the reading, I did believe that less developed countries had limited to no internet access or connectivity to the web. Even electrical issues hinder these countries from developing their way up. And after reading most of the information geographies reading, it reinforced my beliefs with facts. So when it comes to the topic of Web development in Africa, it is influenced by the concept of information geographies, which spoke about the spatial aspects of information and communication technologies around the world. These geographies reveal imbalances in internet access and digital technologies in certain parts of the world. Limited connectivity and unreliable electricity (Load Shedding in our case) hinder progress, making it hard for most web developers exposed to this more often than others. I think that the mapping information geographies helps identify areas lacking digital content production and structures supporting them, pushing for the creation of relevant and inclusive content anyone can excess no matter where their geographic location is. As a South African, I also believe that there is so much talent out there that if they had excess to the right technological tools, could help progress the country's web development space or any digital production space.

          This reading was not what I expected, how localized search results have a major impact on a country or continent depending on how favored or equipped they are for the web. What I mean is that depending on how progressive a country (or continent) is when it comes to internet excess or an advanced technological community, it can favor them when it comes to information excess as it would be catered to them due to access. And this has implications for web development in Africa. Search engine algorithms, influenced by factors like location and language, shape the online experiences of users. This impacts information access, knowledge production, and power dynamics. And since Africans have limited internet excess or minimal to no online presence, most are literally in the dark. So, web developers could address these challenges and maybe create localized content and optimize their websites for local search engines to find them easily (we explored this in a markup lecture with Andre).
