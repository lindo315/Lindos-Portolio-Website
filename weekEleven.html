          So far, looking back at my website I can see the potential it had. How the code worked together (like it's supposed to) and how effective it was in making everything do what it was intended to do, which is what I wanted. It all worked well, only how it was structured was the issue, and the lecture “How we code matters” ironically felt like it was directed at me. This is why I'll merge what I saw from the lecture and what I think of it, all with what I've done in the past myself and what I'm planning on changing.

          It's true that how we code matters, even though I never thought about it. I only looked at code in the frame of, “As long as your application, game, or website works, that's all that matters.” And that's why I'd neglect how and why I was coding the way I was. It all made sense to me what I coded, but for other people, it'd be gibberish with some form or logic behind it. We'e been told countless times in class that when we start working on our careers in the development industry, how we code will be important since we won't be working alone but in big groups and projects. So it's important how your code is formatted or structured. So far, my CSS, HTML, and JavaScript have only become a well-structured units since I've been taking these tutorials and doing these class tasks consistently. Looking at my code now and what I use to do, even for my website assignment, the difference is there.
