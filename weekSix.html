        <strong>Reading Reflection:</strong>One of the key contributions of this paper is the authors' proposal of a "model of user experience," which outlines the different factors that contribute to a user's overall experience of a product. This model includes both the subjective experience of the user (such as their emotions and perceptions) and the objective attributes of the product (such as its usability and aesthetics). By considering both subjective and objective factors, the authors argue, designers can create products that are not only functional and usable, but also enjoyable and meaningful to use.
        Another important aspect of this paper is the authors' emphasis on the importance of context in shaping the user experience. They argue that the same product can elicit very different experiences depending on the context in which it is used (such as the user's goals, preferences, and environment). This suggests that designers should consider the user's context when designing products, and that evaluation of UX should take into account the specific context in which the product is being used.
        Overall, I find this paper to be a valuable contribution to the field of UX design and evaluation. By providing a clear definition of UX and outlining its different dimensions, the authors help to establish UX as a key aspect of product design. The authors' model of user experience is also a useful framework for designers and researchers to use when evaluating and designing products. Finally, the authors' emphasis on context reminds us that UX is not a fixed attribute of a product, but rather a dynamic and context-dependent phenomenon that needs to be considered in product design and evaluation.

        <strong>Progress on my website:</strong> The user flow is already defined in my Design Section. Over the past few days, I've been working hard on coding the front page of my website. While I've run into a couple of code-related issues along the way, I've been able to work through them with some perseverance and help from online resources. Despite the challenges, I'm happy to say that I'm almost done with the front page of my website. I've been able to implement most of the design elements that I had in mind, and the page is starting to look and function the way I had envisioned.Now, I've moved on to coding the design section page of the website. This section will showcase my design work and projects, and I'm excited to bring it to life through my coding skills.Overall, I'm proud of the progress I've made so far, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work on my website and refine my coding skills. While there have been some bumps along the way, I know that each challenge I overcome is helping me to become a better coder and designer
