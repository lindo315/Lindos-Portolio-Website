          <strong>Progress on Website: </strong>Progress on my website and coding tutorials. I have not begun to work on my website yet since I am currently catching up on new classes and tutorials, which I have been finding pretty useful so far. I believe they will help me improve my website if I focus on mastering these new tutorial skills I have learned. Though I have been having issues with JavaScript, the exercises are not impossible, it is just that I get the logic behind them, only when I have to code or remember what lines do what, it is only then that I fall behind. But I am still working on them.

          <strong>Reflection on Reading: </strong>The reading I chose for this week is “Digital Inequalities and why they matter” and it perfectly linked with the previous one we did last week, “Towards a Study of information geographies”. In this reading the author introduces an argument that digital inequalities exist and should not only be preserved for specialists and that it should be taken seriously and be looked upon by social scientists. As the author goes on to say that digital engagements and access play major roles in an individual's success in general. The author also mentions several already existing social inequalities like race, gender, and class, and how these digital inequalities combine with them and exacerbate these issues on the internet. Different authors focus on different points, but I chose to focus on the “Race and Ethnicity” point, to further explore digital inequalities using one idea. The author first mentions how multicultural societies with different social groups, including ethnic and racial minorities, face digital inequalities in accessing and using technology. ICTs either, as mentioned before, exacerbate already existing social inequalities, or mutate them. It is also mentioned that ethnic and racial minorities have lower internet usage overall but still engage more in social media content creation. This is why I believe that the stratification hypothesis is more accurate when it comes to what information certain groups have more access to. If information is categorized based on race, gender, or class, would not that make the current social and political issues we already have much worse? At least that is what I understood from this reading.
