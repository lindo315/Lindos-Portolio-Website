          Learning JavaScript this week was, complicated. Last year we used C# for game design but to tell the honest truth I did not understand 98% of what I was doing last year. Up until last year, I had never coded anything in my entire life and when we started C# we were slingshot miles off from where we started. It was hard keeping up I managed. JavaScript is a bit like C# from what I have noticed, but I am invested this time and excited to see what I can do with it in my website (still working on my wireframes and coding them in with some HTML and CSS).

          In the reading, Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology, Gibson explores the potential for alternative approaches to revolutionize our interactions with computers. He talks about things like virtual reality and augmented reality, and brain-computer interfaces as more natural and intuitive interfaces. He also challenges us with what can be possible (he writes science fiction so why not), as he encourages us to think more creatively about how we interact with computers and the potential for these interfaces to transform our lives. This has given me the understanding that users and developers as well have the freedom to think freely as to how they interact with computers and their interfaces, and that UI can take any shape or form as long as it accommodates its users.

          With the basic principles of user interface design, some of the key principles it makes include making interfaces simple and intuitive, using consistent and predictable design patterns (familiar patterns), providing immediate and clear feedback to users, designing interfaces that provide clear affordances (cues about how to interact with an interface), and ensuring that important elements are visible and easily accessible.

        <h4 class="blog-text">
          By following these principles, designers can create interfaces that are easy to use and understand, which can improve user satisfaction and productivity. In addition, designing interfaces that are based on these principles can help to reduce the learning curve for new users and make it easier for users to accomplish their goals with the software or application. Which is necessary for me to understand while working on my frameworks in the beginning.
