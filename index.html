            Well, no much to say about me. Personally I think I'm an average guy. I'm new to coding, three months in I think. For now I have a decent understanding of two languages. That being HTML and CSS. They can be a pain but I learn fast for an average guy.

          <p class="p-note well">
            I've also been working on creating mini websites just to practice those said skills. JavaScript is currently next in line and for now it seems pretty decent. I think.

              This is one of the few demo-websites I made this year. It mainly focused in bettering my understanding of html and css, so structuring and styling. It's not the best thing I've done so far but it's my first site ever (but it doesn't work, JavaScript not applied). My goal from here on out is to redo the entire site with the focus of improving my styling and UI design. I had no plan while building that site so it was just me practicing my knowledge with html and css.
